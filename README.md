# Contents Limit Calculator
Server side implementation for a contents limit calculator

### Structure
The client application has been written in React and typescript. It was originally implemented [here](https://github.com/NueraInsurance/ContentsCalcFrontEnd), however, I have pulled it into my solution to add the restful calls. Outside of the client folder all the server side implementation is found.

### Tools
The server side application has been written in C# with .net core 2.2. It can be opened and run from Visual Studio's run interface.
SQL lite has been used to store the data, and a base version of the database has been pushed to this repo.

### Instructions for running
1) Run from Visual Studio to start the server
2) Open terminal (or a command promt of your choosing) and go to the client folder
3) run `yarn install` and then `yarn start`
